I have used this laptime simulator to evaluate the impact on lap-time of torque vectoring, rear wheel steering and ground effect 12kWfans. The optimisation framework developed by Martin Gurtner has been expanded by adding a more refined twin track model, suspension, aerodynamics, powertrain, tire model and torque vectoring. This framework uses CASADi to define the optimal control problem and Ipopt to solve it. The vehicle model has been validated on real driving data. The impact of systems has been analysed and verified using CarMaker simulation. The framework developed in this thesis can be used to perform sensitivity analysis of vehicle parameters on lap time and assist with further development of Formula Student vehicle by eForce Prague Formula.
